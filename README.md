MLR-Cancer-analysis

This project is part of the assessment on course STAT1006 at Curtin University, Australia, which I attend in 2022.
I work on the project alone with some advice from Professor Nicola Armstrong
The project was done 100 percent in R.
The professor provided the data, but I had no idea where the data came from.

The main project file is named "main.Rmd"

The data of the project is named "Cancer.Rdata"

The report file is named "Report.pdf"

This project was the very 1st project I had done in data analysis. I apologize for any mistake.
